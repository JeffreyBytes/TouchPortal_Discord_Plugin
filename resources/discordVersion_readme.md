## What are Canary or PTB Versions, and should I download them?

Discord provides multiple versions of its application for Windows, catering to different needs such as stability, experimental features, and early access.

These versions allow users to choose the type of Discord experience they prefer.  
It’s important to note that these Discord versions are **separate and unrelated to our plugin version**.

**The choice of Discord version only determines the Discord client the end user wishes to use alongside our plugin.**

| **Standard Windows Version** | The stable version intended for general users.                             | Fully tested and reliable; all features have undergone quality assurance testing.                                                                                    | Minimal risk. Stable and dependable.                | Users who want a seamless and dependable experience with minimal disruptions.                   |
| **Windows Canary Version**   | An experimental build where new features are first tested.                 | Includes cutting-edge updates and experimental features that are not yet in the stable or PTB builds.                                                               | May contain bugs or crashes; less stable.           | Advanced users, developers, or enthusiasts who want to test and provide feedback on new features. |
| **Windows PTB (Public Test Build)** | A middle ground between Canary and the Stable version.                      | Offers features that are newer than the stable version but have passed preliminary testing in the Canary build.                                                      | More stable than Canary but not guaranteed bug-free. | Users who want to try newer features before they are officially released, with lower risks than Canary. |
